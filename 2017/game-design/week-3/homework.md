1. In the groups formed in class, make a mind map with your assigned videos (below) as your central node
2. Have at least 100 nodes on your mind map per group member
3. Remember to *only add* to the mind map by adding new nodes or connecting existing ones
4. Be supportive of your groupmates! Do not shoot ideas down. The [yes and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DphjhudlZis) technique from improv works great here.
5. Remember quantity over quality at this stage.
6. If you feel creatively exhausted â€“ that's great! Try and dig deeper and see what you find.
7. You can make your mind map however you want. Large paper and markers works great, but so do these online tools: [MindMup](https://www.mindmup.com/), [bubbl](https://bubbl.us/), and [coggle](https://coggle.it).
