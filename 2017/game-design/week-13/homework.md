**Due** 5 Dec 2017

Take the feedback you got from your playtest and begin work on your next iteration. Repeat the brainstorming process and build your next prototype as before. Next week in class will be a workshop day where you will have time to work on your prototypes and I will give each team individual attention. Make sure to come in with questions for me!

The week after that will be our second and last playtest in class, so make sure to have another iteration done by then. Ideally, you will fit more than one iteration into these next two weeks! The more, the better! Remember to document your process so you can tell the story of your iterative process for the final.
