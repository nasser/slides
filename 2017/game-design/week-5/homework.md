date: 3 Oct 2017
school: nyu
class: game design

**Due** 10 Oct 2017

1. Individually, prototype a game in Unity without using any code
2. You can use any built-in Unity components or free assets on the asset store to make your prototype
3. You can use the game design documents you wrote out for homework this class if you like

### Keep in mind

* Your game is made out of GameObjects
* GameObjects are containers for Components
* Components contain **state** (data)
* Components implement the **rules** of your game (behavior)
* You make games in Unity by mixing and matching Components on GameObjects

### Unity's Videos

Unity has some [good videos](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/interface-essentials) on their site. I recommend videos 1 - 6 under *Using the Unity Interface*, 1 & 3 under *Essential Unity Concepts*, and 1 & 2 under *Live Sessions on Unity Interface and Essentials*.
