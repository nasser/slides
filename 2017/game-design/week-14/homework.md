## Schedule
We will *not* meet Tuesday the 12th as that day will run on a Monday schedule across all of NYU. Instead we will meet next on December 19 for your final presentations.

## Iterating and Office Hours
Over the next two weeks make sure to attend at least one of the Playtest Thursdays that are held on the 8th floor at 5:30pm. Test your game the way we did in class, collect feedback and iterate. Remember to document everything to include in your final presentation.

If you need additional help, I will be in the Game Innovation Lab in the ground floor of 5 Metrotech the following days and hours:

* Saturday the 9th: 3pm - 7pm
* Sunday the 17th: 12pm - 7pm

Shoot me an email if you want to come by!

## Final Presentations

For your final I expect a presentation of the story of your development process. Include as many iterations and prototypes as you have documentation for. The more the better. I *greatly* prefer many small iterations over a few big ones. Explain how each iteration reacted to the playtest that preceded it and how your prototype took shape over time. Make sure to demo your latest iteration, but if you want to demo older prototypes that's cool too.

Best of luck!
