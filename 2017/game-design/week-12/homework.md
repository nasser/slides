**Due** 28 Nov 2017

Build the first prototype of your final project and bring it to class to playtest with your classmates. A playtest is an opportunity to get feedback on your game, and to answer specific questions that you come up with while brainstorming and prototyping. These questions and answers will guide your creative practice forward and into new and surprising areas.

### Over The Week

1. Begin by brainstorming your ideas the way we did earlier in the semester
  * What are your goals? What are you trying to do with your final project?
  * What are your constraints, if any?
  * Who are you making this for?
2. Pick out parts of your brainstorm to prototype
  * What *questions* do you have about your game?
  * What are you *unsure* about?
  * Is there any part of your game that other parts of your game depend on?
  * What can you do in a week?
  * What is important? What can wait until later?
3. Build your prototype
  * The code, art, sound, should be *as simple as possible* while still effectively answering the questions you have.
  * For example, if one of your questions is about the graphics of the game, then a game made out of cubes is maybe too simple!
  * On the other hand, if your questions are primarily about interaction and mechanics, then cubes are fine!


### At The Playtest
* Come in with *specific questions* you hope to answer during the playtest
  * Are you unsure if some mechanic is confusing?
  * Are you wondering if a level is too easy? Too hard?
* Come in with *specific moments* you're hoping players have
  * Do you want them to laugh at something?
  * Do you want them to gasp at a certain point?
  * Do you want them to cheer when they win?
* Plan how you're going to explain your game. If your game does not have a tutorial, or is not self-explanatory, you might have to explain the controls and what people's goals are.
* Explaining your game is important, because once someone starts playing

# *YOU CANNOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE INTERFERE WITH A RUNNING PLAYTEST*

* Take notes on people as they play your game, look out for the moments you were hoping for.
* Afterwards, talk to your playtesters about their experience.
  * You can ask them the questions you came in with, or different ones.
  * You can make this as formal as a survey or as casual as a conversation.
  * Take notes either way.
