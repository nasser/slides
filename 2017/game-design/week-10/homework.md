## Final Project Proposals

1. Email a final project proposal to me. Your final project must:
    1. Be made in Unity and programming in C#
    2. Consist of many documented iterations of the ideate, prototype, test cycle. You will present every iteration and prototype of your project, including the final one. Documentation will include photos of mind maps, playable prototypes, notes, and anything else you made while iterating.
2. You can form groups or work alone.
3. I encourage you to combine this project with other final projects if you can.
4. Have fun, explore, experiment, and work on something you're excited about.

## Time Lords
1. Build a prototype that makes use of coroutines and `Time.deltaTime`.
2. Extra points for the most elaborate coroutine you can pull off.
