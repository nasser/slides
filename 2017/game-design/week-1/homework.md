**Due** 12 Sep 2017

1. Play a game of your choosing. Feel free to pick a game off the [games list](../../games) on this site if you like.
2. Watch out for interesting moments
3. Be prepared to talk about what you found compelling about the game in class

Throughout the semester I will expect you to continue playing games. We will start every class off with a conversation around the games people have been playing, and I will add to our games list as the semester goes on.
