1. Make assets using an art package and import them into Unity. Some packages are listed below, but feel free to use anything you're comfortable with.
2. Make a prototype in Unity using the assets you made and the linear algebra we looked at in class. A game about moving or steering things would be great.
3. Start thinking about your final projects. The only constraint is that you develop it in Unity and C#, and that you iterate on it and generate prototypes. The more prototypes you can show the better.

### Art Packages

#### [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
Free, open source, fully featured package for 3D modeling, animating, and more. Popular with indie film makers and game developers.

#### [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview)
Industry standard fully featured 3D modeling and animating package. Higher budget game studios will use this.

#### [ZBrush](http://pixologic.com/)
Digital sculpting package. Used to create super high resolution sculpts of meshes to be further processed by Maya/Blender before being used in game.

#### [Sculptris](http://pixologic.com/sculptris/)
Free ZBrush-like sculpting package maintained by the authors of ZBrush. Lacks a lot of ZBrush's more advanced features, but still provides a good sculpting experience.

#### [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/)
Formerly free architectural modeling software. There is a free version available, but you now have to pay for extra export options, which you need for Unity.

#### [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/)
Free voxel editor and renderer. Something of a middle point between pixel art and 3D art. Great for a block-aesthetic or quick prototypes.

#### [Aesprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)
Pixel sprite editor and animator. Great for palette-based sprite art.

#### [Pixen](https://pixenapp.com/)
Another pixel sprite editor and animator. Also good.

#### [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/pro/)
macOS Photoshop alternative. Cheaper than Photoshop, tends to run faster, and does more or less everything Photoshop can do.


#### [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/)
The inescapable giant. Photoshop and Illustrator are super effective in a game asset pipeline.
