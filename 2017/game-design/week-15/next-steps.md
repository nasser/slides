## Next Steps
Thank you all for a wonderful semester. You all did an incredible job and you should be proud of yourselves. Here are a few jumping off points to help you continue to grow as game designers.

Keep in touch, and stay playful ❤️🎲

### Game Jams
There's usually a game jam going on that you can join. It's a great way to get a constraint and work along side other people. Some great games started as game jam games, including Superhot.

* [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) – This is how I got started!
* [itch.io jams](https://itch.io/jams) – These are all hosted online and really great.
* [Indie Game Jams](http://www.indiegamejams.com/) – Another aggregator of jams from all over the place.

### Communities
Sharing your work and engaging with other people making games is the best way to grow as a game designer.

* [itch.io](https://itch.io) – Free community for indies. They host games, and you can even sell stuff!
* [NYU Game Center Incubator](http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/2018-nyu-game-center-incubator-round-one-applications-open/) Funding and support to develop your games further. Calls open now!
* [Babycastles](https://babycastles.com/) – A wonderfully weird NYC video game gallery. They have he best events!
* [Eyebeam](http://www.eyebeam.org/) – Not specifically games focused, but Eyebeam is a magical place where art and technology collide.

### Festivals
Annual gatherings and opportunities to show off your work. Submitting to festivals is a great motivation to finish a game.

* [IndieCade](http://www.indiecade.com/) – A great festival that grants awards. There is a West and East Coast edition.
* [GDC](http://www.gdconf.com/) – The big show. This is where all the major companies gather, but the Independent Game Festival is a great event.
* [Fantastic Arcade](https://fantasticarcade.com/) – Another great festival, this time in Texas.
* [AMAZE](http://www.a-maze.net/) – A german festival that is open to more experimental games and playful experiences
