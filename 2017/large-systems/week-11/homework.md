**Due** 2 May 2017

## Get the parts
Get the [Serial LED Matrix from Tinkersphere](http://tinkersphere.com/led-matrix-panels/626-serial-led-matrix-module-arduino-compatible.html). You can order online or stop by their [east village store](https://goo.gl/maps/3dEyDCHAF822). This module communicates over the SPI protocol. We will program the module together in class.

## Final Project
Email me what you're thinking of doing for your final project by next class. Even if you've told me in person, send me an email anyway so I have a record of it.

The constraints, if you need them:

1. A design that explains the technical decisions you took when building your network, and the associated rationale (draw boxes with arrows!)
2. A demo of a Large System running that meets our working definition: code in more than one place running at the same time that needs to be coordinated

I encourage working in groups and combining this project with projects in other classes if possible.
