## Make up class
We are meeting on Friday the 5th in room 1202. We will not cover any new material, but I will be available to answer questions about your final projects.

## Evaluations
I believe you can fill them out on Canvas, but I will set aside time in class to do them as well.

## Final Project
Finish your final! Presentations are in class on the 9th! Godspeed!
