## Redis

We're going to be looking at the [Redis](https://redis.io/) database next week. To prepare:

1. Go through the tutorial at [`try.redis.io`](https://try.redis.io/)
2. [Install Redis locally](https://medium.com/@petehouston/install-and-config-redis-on-mac-os-x-via-homebrew-eb8df9a4f298)
3. Try and repeat the commands in the `try.redis.io` tutorial in a [node script](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis)

We will get it running on DigitalOcean together in class next week.

## Doodle
We have two classes to make up, one because of my absence at GDC and one because of the snow day. I've set up a [doodle](https://doodle.com/poll/i544q4iar48zz9fp) to try and coordinate the best times. We will meet at the times with the highest numbers. If you are unable to meet, let me know, and we can schedule time together to get you caught up.


## Final
Start thinking about your final project! My only constraint is that you design and build a large system. I will expect:

1. A design that explains the technical decisions you took when building your network, and the associated rationale (draw boxes with arrows!)
2. A demo of a Large System running that meets our working definition: code in more than one place running at the same time that needs to be coordinated

I encourage working in groups and combining this project with projects in other classes if possible.
