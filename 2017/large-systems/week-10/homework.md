**Due** 25 Apr 2017

## Arduino ↔ Processing
Follow [Sprkfun's tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connecting-arduino-to-processing) to connect an Arduino to a Processing sketch. Getting the basic communication working is enough, but feel free to do more with it if you like.

## Arduino ↔ P5
Using the [p5.serialport](https://github.com/vanevery/p5.serialport) library, connect a p5 sketch to an Arduino. Be mindful of the *event driven* approach that p5/JavsScript presents you with compared to the *loop based* approach that Processing/Java tend to use.

## Make Up Classes
It looks like **Wed Apr 26 7:00-9:40pm** and **Fri May 5 7:00-9:40pm** are the times most people are available, so lets meet then. I will try and schedule a room for us, but for now lets plan on meeting in the common area and going from there.

If you can't meet at those times let me know and we will schedule office hours to get you caught up!

## Final
Settle on an idea. If you are unsure about your idea or need feedback, please email me. We will discuss final project ideas in class next week.

The constraints again from last week's post:

1. A design that explains the technical decisions you took when building your network, and the associated rationale (draw boxes with arrows!)
2. A demo of a Large System running that meets our working definition: code in more than one place running at the same time that needs to be coordinated

I encourage working in groups and combining this project with projects in other classes if possible.
