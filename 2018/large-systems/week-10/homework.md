**Due** 10 Apr 2018

Next week we'll get the code we wrote in class running in the cloud. We're also going to learn another library that builds on express called [socket.io](https://socket.io/). Try and make the [chat application tutorial](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/) work on your laptop for next week.
