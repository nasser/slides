## Back down to Earth

We're leaving the cloud and floating back down to the ground. We'll be looking at hardware for the next two weeks. Try and get through [this tutorial](https://danialk.github.io/blog/2014/04/12/arduino-and-nodejs-communication-with-serial-ports/) to get started.

## Final

Send me your final project proposals! Remember the constraints:

1. A design that explains the technical decisions you took when building your network, and the associated rationale (draw boxes with arrows!)
2. A demo of a Large System running that meets our working definition: code in more than one place running at the same time that needs to be coordinated. It can use anything we've looked at in class: web APIs, local networks, code in the cloud, or hardware (which we will get to in two weeks).

You can work in groups or combine your project with work another class.
