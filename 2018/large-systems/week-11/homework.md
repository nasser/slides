## Sockets in the Cloud

Try to get the socket.io tutorial working locally, and then deployed to your Digital Ocean droplet as we did in class.

## Redis

Weâ€™re going to be looking at the [Redis](https://redis.io/) database next week. To prepare:

1. Go through the tutorial at [`try.redis.io`](https://try.redis.io/)
2. [Install Redis locally](https://medium.com/@petehouston/install-and-config-redis-on-mac-os-x-via-homebrew-eb8df9a4f298)
3. Try and repeat the commands in the `try.redis.io` tutorial in a [node script](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis)

We will get it running on DigitalOcean together in class next week.

## Final

Start thinking about your final project! The only constraint is that you design and build a large system. I will expect:

1. A design that explains the technical decisions you took when building your network, and the associated rationale (draw boxes with arrows!)
2. A demo of a Large System running that meets our working definition: code in more than one place running at the same time that needs to be coordinated. It can use anything we've looked at in class: web APIs, local networks, code in the cloud, or hardware (which we will get to in two weeks).

I encourage working in groups and combining this project with projects in other classes if possible. You don't have to turn in a proposal yet, but will in a week.
