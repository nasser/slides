Use [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to sniff the packets coming in and out of your machine.

1. [Download and install Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/#download)
2. Launch it and select your WiFi interface to sniff ![](wireshark-1.png)
3. Click the blue sharkfin button on the top left to start recording packets ![](wireshark-2.png)
4. Perform specific networked tasks while sniffing, like sending email, interacting on social media, or playing an online game.
5. Click the stop button in the top left
6. Try and find the packets generated from your networked task. Use the filter bar to narrow your search down if you need to.
7. Break the packet down by layer and note what you find ![](wireshark-3.png)

The top pane is a list of every packet found, the middle pane is a decoding of the currently selected packet, and the bottom pane is the raw bytes of the currently selected packet.

Was your data easy to find? Was there anything surprising about it? Come to class prepared to discuss. Wireshark documentation is [available online](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/).
