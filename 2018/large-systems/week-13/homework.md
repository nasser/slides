## Hardware ↔ Hardware
Next week we're going to write code to get an Arduino talking to another microcontroller: [a MAX7219 driving an 8x8 LED Matrix](http://tinkersphere.com/led-matrix-panels/626-serial-led-matrix-module-arduino-compatible.html). It will serve an as an example of two non-computers talking and what that protocol looks like. You can pick up the 8x8 Matrix at [Tinkersphere in the East Village](https://goo.gl/maps/zNWKATfrH4p) if you'd like to follow along in class, but you're not required to.

## socket.io → Arduino
Try and build on the code from class to connect a socket.io app to your Arduino. We will do something similar in class.

## Deactivating Digital Ocean
If you want to cancel your Digital Ocean account, you can do so by clicking Deactivate Account in your control panel. This [post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-do-i-cancel-my-account) has some more details.

## Final
If you haven't already, please send me your final project proposals! I will get you feedback over email this week.

If you're stuck on an idea, here are some past projects. They don't all have documentation, so you might need to poke around in the source to get them running again, but they might be useful nonetheless:
