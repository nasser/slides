**Due** 3 Apr 2018

Next week we're ascending to the cloud.

We will be using Digital Ocean to host and run our code in the cloud. [Please sign up for their cheapest an account](https://www.digitalocean.com/), it should be $5/month.

## Frankenstein Source Code

If it's useful, [here's the source code](https://github.com/nasser/frankenstein) to my Frankenstein piece from the installation in January. It uses OSC much in the same way we've done in class, namely [setting up the server](https://github.com/nasser/frankenstein/blob/master/index.html#L66) and [sending messages](https://github.com/nasser/frankenstein/blob/master/js/state.js#L129). It's wrapped up in its [own script](https://github.com/nasser/frankenstein/blob/master/js/network.js), but its the same.
